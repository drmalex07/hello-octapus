hello-octapus
=============

This is a Hello-World repository. 
I use this only for testing Git functionality!

The `hello.py` program is also a simple helloworld program.
The `goodbye.py` is another variation, that instead of "hello" says "goodbye".

A `setup.py` is also here to manifest a simple Python package!

As you've noticed, this README is following the reStructuredText format!
